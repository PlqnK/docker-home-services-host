# Infrastructure

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure, managed with Ansible.

## Stack Overview

I have 2 DELL Optiplex Micro to run my workloads. One is running Proxmox VE and the other one Fedora CoreOS. On the Proxmox host there are 3 Virtual Machines, all running Fedora CoreOS.

As well as the following resources :

- An OPNsense firewall with:
  - A public IPv4 and IPv6 prefix.
  - Unbound configured with a record for each hosts.
  - HAProxy as a transparent SNI proxy to route external HTTPS traffic to the proper host based on the SNI header.
- A DNS zone for my public domain name managed by deSEC.
- A TrueNAS server that host all my files and provide NFS exports to my containers hosts.

I chose the following software stack for my container hosts:

- OS : Fedora CoreOS, I already use Fedora on my desktop and laptop and I wanted an immutable OS for my servers using the same base.
- Services runtime : Podman with systemd quadlets units to manage the containers.

## Codebase Overview

### Make

The `Makefile` contains all the useful commands to manage the infrastructure, run `make help` to see the list of available commands.

### Secrets management

All the secrets are stored in the `inventories/production.yml` which is encrypted using `ansible-vault`. The `vault-pass.sh` uses the bitwarden CLI to retrieve the vault password from my Bitwarden vault.

Run `make vault` to edit the `production.yml` inventory in your `$EDITOR`.

### OS provisioning

Fedora CoreOS uses Ignition to provision the OS on first boot. The Ignition files are generated using Butane files stored in the `templates/coreos/` folder as jinja templates.

The `ignition.yml` playbook will template the butane files and generate the Ignition files in the `files/coreos/` folder and serve them using a simple Python HTTP Server on port 8000.

### Ansible provisioning

The Ansible code configures and deploys the following:

- The Proxmox VE host (networking, alerting, smart monitoring etc.)
- The Fedora CoreOS hosts (networking, NFS mounts, Podman installation etc.)
- All the containerized services running on the Fedora CoreOS hosts

The services roles follow the following structure:

- `tasks/create.yml`: Create all the necessary resources (DNS records, bind mounts, networks, containers etc.)
- `tasks/lifecycle.yml`: Start/Stop/Restart/Enable/Disable the services containers
- `tasks/db-upgrade.yml`: Upgrade the database schema if doing a major version upgrade
- `tasks/remove.yml`: Remove all the services resources (created by `create.yml`)
- `templates/*.container.j2`: Podman container quadlet templates

Run `make provision` to provision all the hosts using Ansible.

### Updating

All the containers hosts are configured to auto-update:

- Their OS every week using `zincati`.
- Their containers using "custom" systemd timers that pull the latest image before `zincati` execution and eventual host reboot. If the host didn't reboot an other script recreate the containers that have pulled a new image.

Run `make update` to update services when a tag has changed.

Run `make db-upgrade` when updating to a new PostgreSQL major version.
